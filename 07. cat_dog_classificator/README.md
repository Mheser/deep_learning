👏 Congratulations for coding your first Convolutional Neural Networks !

👨🏻‍🏫 For the recap session, let's take a look at the following ideas:

- 😇 __1️⃣ Cats and Dogs:__ A walkthrough of the full process of loading data, comparing different vision models, seeing the benefits of transfer learning and data augmentation, saving/ loading models, then predicting on some data in the wild!

- 🤯 **3️⃣. (Optional Bonus)** Let's review together the challenge `05-Autoencoders`!
